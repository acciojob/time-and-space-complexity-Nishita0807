	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of its input size. efficient time complexity is a key goal when designing algorithms, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of software systems.</p>
	<p>
<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It is a crucial factor to consider when analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm. In the context of space complexity, the notation "O(n)" is often used to represent the upper bound of the space an algorithm requires, where "n" represents the size of the input data.</p>
